Client to Server:

1. Call sgx_ra_get_msg1(Context returned by sgx_ra_init, ID of the enclave, sgx_ra_get_ga, ptr for returned context) inside the untrusted application.

2. Send the msg1 to the service provider.

Note: sgx_tkey_exchange.edl must be imported as the sgx_ra_get_ga is a variable of that library.
