Client to Server:

1. Execute an ECALL to enter the enclave.

2. Call sgx_ra_init(ServiceProviderPublicKey, PSE?, ptr for returned context) inside the enclave.

3. Return the result and the DHKE context to untrusted application.

4. Call sgx_get_extended_epid_groud_id inside the untrusted application to get the GID.

5. GID must be sent to the service provider.
