Required Files in Enclave folder:
1. Enclave.config.xml - contains the configuration about the enclave.
2. Enclave.cpp - contains the implementation of Ecall functions.
3. Enclave.edl - contains the information about each function used by both the application and the enclave, including both Ecall and Ocall, residing in the trusted and untrusted sessions.
4. Enclave_private.pem - contains unencrypted RSA.

Required Files in App folder:
1. App.cpp - contains the functionality of the application, this file must take care of the enclave such as initializing the enclave and checking the status of the enclave, and this file must contain the implementation of Ocall functions.
2. Other .cpp/.h files in this folder is for application development.

To compile with simulation mode:
1. cmake -DSGX_MODE:STRING=SIM
2. make
To compile with SGX hardware enabled machine:
1. cmake -DSGX_MODE:STRING=HW
2. make

To run the program:
./app

Specification:
1. Ocall functions implementation should reside in the application; therefore, they are listed as untrusted in the Enclave.edl file.
2. Ecall functinos implementation should reside in the enclave; therefore, they are listed as trusted in the Enclave.edl file.
